## Introduction

In today's date understanding the factors which contribute to players overall rating is crucial for everyone who is involved in team building exercise, such as Managers, scouts and coaches. This is crucial because it helps them to make better informed decisions on making best lineup for the forth coming seasons. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict overall rating of player based on the various factors. By providing accurate prediciton, this tool can help players as well as Management department to identify players who need additional support or change in their training methods to focus on key areas to strengthen their particular ability.

**Note: This Project is for Educational Purpose Only**

The overall rating Predictor project is developed for educational purposes to showcase the application of machine learning techniques in predicting player's performance. The results obtained from this project are based on a specific dataset and machine learning model, and should not be considered as definitive or accurate predictions for real-world scenarios. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the end-to-end process of developing a machine learning model and provide insights into the factors influencing player's performance.
